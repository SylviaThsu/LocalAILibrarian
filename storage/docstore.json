To its adherents, it is an elegant statement about\nlearning from experience. To its opponents, it is subjectivity run amok. In the\nfirst-ever account of Bayes\u2019 rule for general readers, Sharon Bertsch\nMcGrayne explores this controversial theorem and the human obsessions\nsurrounding it. She traces its discovery by an amateur mathematician in the\n1740s through its development into roughly its modern form by French\nscientist Pierre Simon Laplace. She reveals why respected statisticians\nrendered it professionally taboo for 150 years\u2014at the same time that", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2038, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "308dc3a6-04ac-4ecb-a2c2-a9c864d6c42f": {"__data__": {"id_": "308dc3a6-04ac-4ecb-a2c2-a9c864d6c42f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf_part_5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "hash": "f3e11238f8b3f86dbd6014172017b6e74d136bc047129689ed37ea0df57b83ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "practitioners relied on it to solve crises involving great uncertainty and\nscanty information, even breaking Germany\u2019s Enigma code during World War\nII, and explains how the advent of off-the-shelf computer technology in the\n1980s proved to be a game-changer.

It concerned a broader and more fundamental issue:\nhow we analyze evidence, change our minds as we get new information, and\nmake rational decisions in the face of uncertainty. And it was not resolved\nuntil the dawn of the twenty-first century.\nOn its face Bayes\u2019 rule is a simple, one-line theorem: by updating our\ninitial belief about something with objective new information, we get a new\nand improved belief. To its adherents, this is an elegant statement about\nlearning from experience. Generations of converts remember experiencing an\nalmost religious epiphany as they fell under the spell of its inner logic.\nOpponents, meanwhile, regarded Bayes\u2019 rule as subjectivity run amok.\nBayes\u2019 rule began life amid an inflammatory religious controversy in\nEngland in the 1740s: can we make rational conclusions about God based on\nevidence about the world around us? An amateur mathematician, the\nReverend Thomas Bayes, discovered the rule, and we celebrate him today as\nthe iconic father of mathematical decision making. Yet Bayes consigned his\ndiscovery to oblivion. In his time, he was a minor figure. And we know\nabout his work today only because of his friend and editor Richard Price, an\nalmost forgotten hero of the American Revolution.\nBy rights, Bayes\u2019 rule should be named for someone else: a Frenchman,\nPierre Simon Laplace, one of the most powerful mathematicians and\nscientists in history. To deal with an unprecedented torrent of data, Laplace\ndiscovered the rule on his own in 1774. Over the next forty years he\ndeveloped it into the form we use today.

Only historical convention forces us to call\nLaplace\u2019s discovery Bayes\u2019 rule.\nAfter Laplace\u2019s death, researchers and academics seeking precise and\nobjective answers pronounced his method subjective, dead, and buried. Yet\nat the very same time practical problem solvers relied on it to deal with real-\nworld emergencies. One spectacular success occurred during the Second\nWorld War, when Alan Turing developed Bayes to break Enigma, the German\nnavy\u2019s secret code, and in the process helped to both save Britain and invent\nmodern electronic computers and software. Other leading mathematical\nthinkers\u2014Andrei Kolmogorov in Russia and Claude Shannon in New York\n\u2014also rethought Bayes for wartime decision making.\nDuring the years when ivory tower theorists thought they had rendered\nBayes taboo, it helped start workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the United\nStates; save the Bell Telephone system from the financial panic of 1907;\ndeliver Alfred Dreyfus from a French prison; direct Allied artillery fire and\nlocate German U-boats; and locate earthquake epicenters and deduce\n(erroneously) that Earth\u2019s core consists of molten iron.\nTheoretically, Bayes\u2019 rule was verboten. But it could deal with all kinds\nof data, whether copious or sparse. During the Cold War, Bayes helped find a\nmissing H-bomb and U.S. and Russian submarines; investigate nuclear power\nplant safety; predict the shuttle Challenger tragedy; demonstrate that smoking\ncauses lung cancer and that high cholesterol causes heart attacks; predict\npresidential winners on television\u2019s most popular news program, and much\nmore.\nHow could otherwise rational scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians\nbecome so obsessed about a theorem that their argument became, as one\nobserver called it, a massive food fight? The answer is simple. At its heart,\nBayes runs counter to the deeply held conviction that modern science\nrequires objectivity and precision. Bayes is a measure of belief.

mysteriously abandoned it. It was\nrediscovered independently by a different and far more renowned man,\nPierre Simon Laplace, who gave it its modern mathematical form and\nscientific application\u2014and then moved on to other methods. Although Bayes\u2019\nrule drew the attention of the greatest statisticians of the twentieth century,\nsome of them vilified both the method and its adherents, crushed it, and\ndeclared it dead. Yet at the same time, it solved practical questions that were\nunanswerable by any other means: the defenders of Captain Dreyfus used it\nto demonstrate his innocence; insurance actuaries used it to set rates; Alan\nTuring used it to decode the German Enigma cipher and arguably save the\nAllies from losing the Second World War; the U.S. Navy used it to search for\na missing H-bomb and to locate Soviet subs; RAND Corporation used it to\nassess the likelihood of a nuclear accident; and Harvard and Chicago\nresearchers used it to verify the authorship of the Federalist Papers. In\ndiscovering its value for science, many supporters underwent a near-\nreligious conversion yet had to conceal their use of Bayes\u2019 rule and pretend\nthey employed something else. It was not until the twenty-first century that the\nmethod lost its stigma and was widely and enthusiastically embraced. The\nstory began with a simple thought experiment.\nBecause Bayes\u2019 gravestone says he died in 1761 at the age of 59, we know\nhe lived during England\u2019s struggle to recover from nearly two centuries of\nreligious strife, civil war, and regicide.

By Bayes\u2019 time, mathematics was split along religious and political\nlines, and many productive mathematicians were amateurs because, as\nDissenters, they were barred from English universities.1\nUnable to earn a degree in England, Bayes studied theology and\npresumably mathematics at the University of Edinburgh in Presbyterian\nScotland, where, happily for him, academic standards were much more\nrigorous. In 1711 he left for London, where his clergyman father ordained\nhim and apparently employed him as an assistant minister.\nPersecution turned many English Dissenters into feisty critics, and in his\nlate 20s Bayes took a stand on a hot theological issue: can the presence of\nevil be reconciled with God\u2019s presumed beneficence? In 1731 he wrote a\npamphlet\u2014a kind of blog\u2014declaring that God gives people \u201cthe greatest\nhappiness of which they are capable.\u201d\nDuring his 40s, Bayes\u2019 interests in mathematics and theology began to\ntightly intertwine. An Irish-Anglican bishop\u2014George Berkeley, for whom\nthe University of California\u2019s flagship campus is named\u2014published an\ninflammatory pamphlet attacking Dissenting mathematicians, calculus,\nabstract mathematics, the revered Isaac Newton, and all other \u201cfree-thinkers\u201d\nand \u201cinfidel mathematicians\u201d who believed that reason could illuminate any\nsubject.

In criticizing concepts about cause and effect Hume was\nundermining Christianity\u2019s core beliefs.\nHume\u2019s essay was nonmathematical, but it had profound scientific\nimplications. Many mathematicians and scientists believed fervently that\nnatural laws did indeed prove the existence of God, their First Cause.

Today, probability, the\nmathematics of uncertainty, would be the obvious tool, but during the early\n1700s probability barely existed. Its only extensive application was to\ngambling, where it dealt with such basic issues as the odds of getting four\naces in one poker hand. De Moivre, who had spent several years in French\nprisons because he was a Protestant, had already solved that problem by\nworking from cause to effect. But no one had figured out how to turn his work\naround backward to ask the so-called inverse question from effect to cause:\nwhat if a poker player deals himself four aces in each of three consecutive\nhands? What is the underlying chance (or cause) that his deck is loaded?\nWe don\u2019t know precisely what piqued Bayes\u2019 interest in the inverse\nprobability problem. He had read de Moivre\u2019s book, and the Earl of\nStanhope was interested in probability as it applied to gambling.\nAlternatively, it could have been the broad issues raised by Newton\u2019s theory\nof gravitation.

To quantify the problem, he needed a\nnumber, and sometime between 1746 and 1749 he hit on an ingenious\nsolution. As a starting point he would simply invent a number\u2014he called it a\nguess\u2014and refine it later as he gathered more information.\nNext, he devised a thought experiment, a 1700s version of a computer\nsimulation.

On a piece of paper he draws a square to represent the surface\nof the table. He begins by having an associate toss an imaginary cue ball onto\nthe pretend tabletop. Because his back is turned, Bayes does not know where\nthe cue ball has landed.\nNext, we picture him asking his colleague to throw a second ball onto the\ntable and report whether it landed to the right or left of the cue ball. If to the\nleft, Bayes realizes that the cue ball is more likely to sit toward the right side\nof the table. Again Bayes\u2019 friend throws the ball and reports only whether it\nlands to the right or left of the cue ball.

Assuming equal probabilities was a pragmatic\napproach for dealing with uncertain circumstances. The practice was rooted\nin traditional Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s ban on usury. In\nuncertain situations such as annuities or marine insurance policies, all parties\nwere assigned equal shares and divided profits equally. Even prominent\nmathematicians assigned equal probabilities to gambling odds by assuming,\nwith a remarkable lack of realism, that all tennis players or fighting cocks\nwere equally skillful.\nIn time, the practice of assigning equal probabilities acquired a number of\nnames, including equal priors, equal a priori\u2019s, equiprobability, uniform\ndistribution probability, and the law of insufficient reason (meaning that\nwithout enough data to assign specific probabilities, equal ones would\nsuffice). Despite their venerable history, equal probabilities would become a\nlightning rod for complaints that Bayes was quantifying ignorance.\nToday, some historians try to absolve him by saying he may have applied\nequal probabilities to his data (the subsequent throws) rather than to the\ninitial, so-called prior toss.

As far as we know, no one else mentioned the essay for\nthe next 17 years, when Price would again bring Bayes\u2019 rule to light.\nBy modern standards, we should refer to the Bayes-Price rule. Price\ndiscovered Bayes\u2019 work, recognized its importance, corrected it, contributed\nto the article, and found a use for it. The modern convention of employing\nBayes\u2019 name alone is unfair but so entrenched that anything else makes little\nsense.\nAlthough it was ignored for years, Bayes\u2019 solution to the inverse\nprobability of causes was a masterpiece. He transformed probability from a\ngambler\u2019s measure of frequency into a measure of informed belief. A card\nplayer could start by believing his opponent played with a straight deck and\nthen modify his opinion each time a new hand was dealt. Eventually, the\ngambler could wind up with a better assessment of his opponent\u2019s honesty.\nBayes combined judgments based on prior hunches with probabilities\nbased on repeatable experiments. He introduced the signature features of\nBayesian methods: an initial belief modified by objective new information.\nHe could move from observations of the world to abstractions about their\nprobable cause. And he discovered the long-sought grail of probability, what\nfuture mathematicians would call the probability of causes, the principle of\ninverse probability, Bayesian statistics, or simply Bayes\u2019 rule.\nGiven the revered status of his work today, it is also important to\nrecognize what Bayes did not do. He did not produce the modern version of\nBayes\u2019 rule. He did not even employ an algebraic equation; he used\nNewton\u2019s old-fashioned geometric notation to calculate and add areas. Nor\ndid he develop his theorem into a powerful mathematical method. Above all,\nunlike Price, he did not mention Hume, religion, or God.\nInstead, he cautiously confined himself to the probability of events and did\nnot mention hypothesizing, predicting, deciding, or taking action.

A trio of\nFrench astronomers, Alexis Claude Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-\nReine Lepaute, the wife of a celebrated clockmaker, solved a difficult three-\nbody problem and discovered that the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn\nwould delay the arrival of Halley\u2019s comet.

For Laplace, these questions demonstrated that ancient biblical\naccounts by the Apostles lacked credibility.\nWhile still counting babies, Laplace returned to study the seeming instability\nof Saturn and Jupiter\u2019s orbits, the problem that had helped sensitize him early\nin his career to uncertain data. He did not, however, use his new knowledge\nof probability to solve this important problem. He used other methods\nbetween 1785 and 1788 to determine that Jupiter and Saturn oscillate gently\nin an 877-year cycle around the sun and that the moon orbits Earth in a cycle\nmillions of years long. The orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, and the moon were not\nexceptions to Newton\u2019s gravitation but thrilling examples of it. The solar\nsystem was in equilibrium, and the world would not end. This discovery was\nthe biggest advance in physical astronomy since Newton\u2019s law of gravity.\nDespite Laplace\u2019s astounding productivity, his life as a professional scientist\nwas financially precarious. Fortunately, Paris in the 1700s had more\neducational institutions and scientific opportunities than anywhere else on\nEarth, and academy members could patch jobs together to make a respectable\nliving. Laplace tripled his income by examining artillery and naval\nengineering students three or four months a year and serving as a scientist in\nthe Duke of Orleans\u2019 entourage.

He referred to it fondly as his\nsource of large numbers and the inspiration behind his development and use\nof generating functions.\nAnd finally, in the climax of one small part of his career, he proved the\nelegant, general version of his theorem that we now call Bayes\u2019 rule.

This could range from assessments of national or\nhistoric trends to an executive\u2019s mental health. Methods for utilizing both\nstatistical and nonstatistical types of evidence were needed.\nUsing Laplace\u2019s formula, Molina combined his prior information about the\neconomics of automating Bell telephone systems with data about telephone\ncall traffic, call length, and waiting time.

The amount we wager\nshows how much we believe in something.\nIn 1924 a French mathematician, \u00c9mile Borel, concluded that a person\u2019s\nsubjective degree of belief could be measured by the amount he was willing\nto bet.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1949, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51165c28-fd6a-4396-b6a9-a8c9a97148e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "51165c28-fd6a-4396-b6a9-a8c9a97148e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf_part_70", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "hash": "b60b1f0b3777d0b2ae30544feb705b7a923adca3d721a07c534724697502d0ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa25dce5-e847-4c61-875f-9b8f9be83d3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "hash": "e468b683d6531c89b145cec6790900db0d6a2b2b141d49858f848ada082ba4dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In 1924 a French mathematician, \u00c9mile Borel, concluded that a person\u2019s\nsubjective degree of belief could be measured by the amount he was willing\nto bet.

Ramsey made the same suggestion. Before he\ndied at the age of 26 following surgeries for jaundice, he wondered how we\nshould make decisions in the face of uncertainty. In an informal talk to\nstudents at the Moral Sciences Club at Cambridge University in 1926\nRamsey suggested that probability was based on personal beliefs that could\nbe quantified by a wager. Such extreme subjectivity broke radically with\nprevious thinkers like Mill, who had denounced subjective probabilities as\nthe abhorrent quantification of ignorance.\nRamsey, who in his brief career also contributed to economics, logic, and\nphilosophy, believed uncertainty had to be described in terms of probability\nrather than by tests and procedures. By talking about a measure of belief as a\nbasis for action and by introducing a utility function and the maximization of\nexpected utility, he showed how to act in the face of uncertainty. Neither\nBayes nor Laplace had ventured into the world of decisions and behavior.\nBecause Ramsey worked in Cambridge, England, the history of Bayes\u2019 rule\nmight have been quite different had he lived longer.\nAt almost the same time as Borel and Ramsey, an Italian actuary and\nmathematics professor, Bruno de Finetti, also suggested that subjective\nbeliefs could be quantified at the racetrack.

For 50 years, until DNA\nprofiling became available, American lawyers used the Essen-M\u00f6ller index\nwithout knowing its Bayesian paternity.

With Bayes, he determined the most therapeutic doses\nfor human cancer patients by sacrificing a relatively small number of cats,\n27.

Quantum mechanics was new\nand chic, and Bayes was not.\nIn addition, Fisher\u2019s techniques, written in a popular style with minimal\nmathematics, were easier to apply than those of Jeffreys. A biologist or\npsychologist could easily use Fisher\u2019s manual to determine whether results\nwere statistically significant. To use Jeffreys\u2019s rather opaque and\nmathematical approach, a scientist had to choose among five nuanced\ncategories: the evidence against the hypothesis is \u201cnot worth more than a\nbare mention\u201d or it is substantial, strong, very strong, or decisive.57\nCharacteristically, Jeffreys tucked the five categories into appendix B of his\nbook.\nFinally and most important, Jeffreys was interested in making inferences\nfrom scientific evidence, not in using statistics to guide future action. To him,\ndecision making\u2014so important for the rise of mathematical statistics during\nthe Second World War and the Cold War\u2014was irrelevant. Others parted at\nthe same divide: a big reason for the feud between Fisher and Neyman, for\nexample, was decision theory.\nAll these factors left Jeffreys almost totally isolated from statistical\ntheorists. His link with Fisher was their interest in applying statistics to\nscience. Jeffreys knew Ramsey and visited him as he was dying in the\nhospital, but neither realized the other was working on probability theory; in\nany case, Jeffreys was interested in scientific inference and Ramsey in\ndecision making.

Many of\nthese settings were changed every two days, sometimes every 8 or 24 hours.\nAccording to Frank Birch, head of the GC&CS naval intelligence branch,\nsuperior officers informed him that the \u201cGerman codes were unbreakable.

Defeatism at the\nbeginning of the war, to my mind, played a large part in delaying the breaking\nof the codes.\u201d7 The naval codes were assigned to one officer and one clerk;\nnot a single cryptanalyst was involved.

He had\nboth the theory and the method for breaking Enigma codes but still could not\nread U-boat messages.

He needed to see one of the code-\nbooks that U-boat Enigma operators used before broadcasting a ciphered\nmessage. One of the factors that made breaking the Enigma code so difficult\nwas that the operator doubly-enciphered a trio of letters that began each\nmessage and that indicated the starting positions of the Enigma\u2019s three\nwheels. The operator enciphered the three letters twice over: once\nmechanically, with his Enigma machine, and once manually, by selecting one\nof nine sets of tables in a codebook issued to each sub. The operator learned\nwhich table to use each day by consulting a calendar issued with the tables. If\na U-boat came under attack, crews had strict orders to destroy the tables\neither before abandoning ship or as the enemy was about to board.\nIn a brilliant piece of deduction shortly after war was declared, Turing\nfigured out this double-encipherment system, but he needed a copy of the\ncodebook to make Banburismus work.

The Americans seemed uninterested in the\nEnigma outside of their obligation to supply bombes for it.\nIn Washington, Turing discussed Bletchley Park\u2019s methods and bombes\nwith U.S. Navy cryptographers. According to a previous agreement, the\nUnited States was concentrating on Japanese navy codes and ciphers while\nthe British worked on Enigma. Bletchley Park had already sent a detailed\ntechnical report of its work to the Americans, but a civilian navy\ncryptographer, Agnes Meyer Driscoll, had sat on it; she had broken many\nJapanese codes and ciphers before the war and had her own, mistaken\nnotions about how to solve Germany\u2019s naval Enigma. Turing\u2019s mathematics\nmay also have been too technical for the Americans.

He worked alone, isolated from academic\nthinkers and from his actuarial colleagues, who scratched their heads at\nBailey\u2019s brilliance.\nAfter the war, in 1947, Bailey moved to the New York State Insurance\nDepartment as the regulatory agency\u2019s chief actuary.

Although his old-fashioned notation was\ndifficult to understand, he was building a mathematical foundation to justify\nthe use of current rates as the priors in Bayes\u2019 theorem. He started his paper\nwith a biblical justification for using prior beliefs: \u201cIf thou canst believe,\u201d he\nwrote, quoting the apostle Mark, \u201call things are possible to him that\nbelieveth.\u201d Then, reviewing Albert Whitney\u2019s mathematics for workers\u2019\ncompensation, Bailey affirmed the Bayesian roots of the Credibility theory\ndeveloped for workers\u2019 compensation insurance years before. Credibility\nwas central to actuarial thought, and while relative frequencies were\nrelevant, so were other kinds of information.

Only as the British\nslowly declassified his cryptanalysis work could he reveal Bayes\u2019 success\nwith the Enigma code. When that happened, he bought a vanity license plate\nemblazoned with his James Bond spy status and his initials, 007 IJG.\nHampered by governmental secrecy, his own personality, and an inability\nto explain his work, Good remained an independent voice within the\nBayesian community as two others became its intellectual leaders.\nUnlike Good, Dennis Lindley and Jimmie Savage evolved almost\naccidentally as Bayesians. When Lindley was a boy during the German\nbombing of London, a remarkable mathematics teacher named M. P.\nMeshenberg tutored him in the school\u2019s air raid shelter. Meshenberg\nconvinced Dennis\u2019s father, a roofer proud to have never read a book, that the\nboy should not quit school early or be apprenticed to an architect. Because of\nMeshenberg, Dennis stayed in school and won a mathematics scholarship to\nattend Cambridge University. Later in the war, when the British government\nasked mathematicians to learn some statistics, Lindley helped introduce\nstatistical quality control and inspection into armaments production for the\nMinistry of Supply.\nAfter the war he returned to Cambridge, the British center of probability,\nwhere Jeffreys, Fisher, Turing, and Good had either worked or studied.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2048, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e4e84b2-eefb-4b3e-91ef-311e598238db": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e4e84b2-eefb-4b3e-91ef-311e598238db", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf_part_124", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "hash": "ce3432b638d051c25b5d482b8f3565bdbcb300cb49885a06d9f50afb75b0e94a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfe18a99-b722-4355-8187-299c97fca15b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "125", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "hash": "9c23d92fec95f1df2fefa3a5e61b20dbd356ca1840167b928b3b8cf50a3067ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "After the war he returned to Cambridge, the British center of probability,\nwhere Jeffreys, Fisher, Turing, and Good had either worked or studied.\nThere Lindley became interested in turning the statisticians\u2019 collection of\nmiscellaneous tools into a \u201crespectable branch of mathematics,\u201d a complete\nbody of thought based on axioms and proven theorems.13 Andrei Kolmogorov\nhad done the same for probability in general in the 1930s.

Fermi himself used Bayes. In the autumn of 1953,\nwhen Jay Orear, one of Fermi\u2019s graduate students, was struggling with a\nproblem involving three unknown quantities, Fermi told him to use a simple\nanalytic method that he called Bayes\u2019 theorem and that he had derived from\nC.

As Savage explained, when he wrote the book he was \u201cnot yet a\npersonalistic Bayesian.\u201d He thought he came to Bayesian statistics \u201cseriously\nonly through recognition of the likelihood principle; and it took me a year or\ntwo to make the transition.\u201d21\nAccording to the likelihood principle, all the information in experimental\ndata gets encapsulated in the likelihood portion of Bayes\u2019 theorem, the part\ndescribing the probability of objective new data; the prior played no role.\nPractically speaking, the principle greatly streamlined analysis. Scientists\ncould stop running an experiment when they were satisfied with the result or\nran out of time, money, and patience; nonBayesians had to continue until\nsome frequency criterion was met. Bayesians would also be able to\nconcentrate on what happened, not on what could have happened according\nto Neyman-Pearson\u2019s sampling plan.\nThe transition to Bayes took Savage several years, but by the early 1960s\nhe had accepted its logic wholeheartedly, fusing subjective probability with\nnew statistical tools for scientific inference and decision making. As far as\nSavage was concerned, Bayes\u2019 rule filled a need that other statistical\nprocedures could not. Frequentism\u2019s origin in genetics and biology meant it\nwas involved with group phenomena, populations, and large aggregations of\nsimilar objects.

With the help of\nBayes\u2019 rule\u2014what Laplace had called \u201cthe probability of causes and future\nevents, derived from past events\u201d\u2014Cornfield provided the theoretical\njustification for using case-control studies to estimate the strength of links\nbetween exposure and disease. Today, thanks to Cornfield, case-control\nstudies are the primary tool epidemiologists use to identify likely causes of\nchronic diseases.\nOver his career, Cornfield would become involved in every major public\nhealth problem of the day. Most of them, including smoking, the safety of\npolio vaccines, and the efficacy of diabetes treatments, were fiercely\ncontroversial.\nTo calm the statistics phobia of physicians and epidemiologists, Cornfield\ndeveloped an easygoing bedside manner. Abandoning his serious phase, he\ncultivated an infectious laugh and an irrepressible air of informality. By\nmixing humor into conversations, telling stories, and laughing heartily he\ninspired tremendous confidence. Even his gait and prose became sprightly.\nSoon every biomedical scientist with a committee and a controversy wanted\nCornfield on board.

He chose Bayes\u2019 rule and used cardiovascular\ndeath rates as the prior. Framingham gave him data about two groups of\npeople, those who had died of heart disease and those who had not. Within\neach group he had information about seven risk factors. Calculating Bayes\u2019\nrule, he got a posterior probability in the form of a logistic regression\nfunction, which he then used to identify the four most important risk factors\nfor cardiovascular disease. In addition to age itself, they were cholesterol,\ncigarette smoking, heart abnormalities, and blood pressure.\nBayes allowed Cornfield to reframe Framingham\u2019s data in terms of the\nprobability that people with particular characteristics would get heart\ndisease. There was no critical level for cholesterol or blood pressure below\nwhich people were safe and above which they got the disease. And patients\ncursed with both high cholesterol and high blood pressure were 23% more at\nrisk for heart attacks than those with low cholesterol and blood pressure\nrates.\nCornfield\u2019s identification in 1962 of the most critical risk factors for\ncardiovascular disease produced one of the most important public health\nachievements of the twentieth century: a dramatic drop in death rates from\ncardiovascular disease.

His report also showed researchers how to use Bayes\u2019\nrule to analyze several risk factors at a time; his multiple logistic risk\nfunction has been called one of epidemiology\u2019s greatest methodologies.\nTo measure the efficacy of a particular therapy, Cornfield used an early\nmulticenter trial at NIH to introduce another Bayesian concept\u2014Harold\nJeffreys\u2019s relative betting odds.

He had started out using\nBayes\u2019 theorem as an enabling tool to solve a particular problem, the way it\nhad been used for cryptography, submarine hunting, and artillery fire during\nthe Second World War. But now he was moving gradually toward making\nBayes\u2019 theorem the foundation of a broad philosophy for handling\ninformation and uncertainties.

While Fisher considered a hypothesis significant if it was\nunlikely to have occurred by chance, Cornfield declared airily, \u201cIf\nmaintenance of [Fisher\u2019s] significance level interferes with the release of\ninterim results, all I can say is so much the worse for the significance\nlevel.\u201d10\nInterestingly, most of NIH\u2019s other statisticians failed to follow their leader\ninto Bayesian fields. Cornfield published scientifically important papers\nabout Bayesian inference in mainstream statistics journals.

Gen. Curtis E. LeMay,\nthe commander of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), had helped start it in\nSanta Monica, California, 10 years earlier as \u201ca gimmick\u201d to cajole top\nscientists into applying operations research to long-range air warfare.1 But\nRAND, an acronym for Research ANd Development, considered itself a\n\u201cuniversity without students\u201d and its 1,000-odd employees \u201cdefense\nintellectuals.\u201d Their mission was to use mathematics, statistics, and\ncomputers to solve military problems, pioneer decision making under\nconditions of uncertainty, and save the United States from Soviet attack. The\nU.S. Air Force, which funded RAND, gave its researchers carte blanche to\nchoose the problems they wanted to investigate. But since President\nEisenhower\u2019s \u201cNew Look\u201d military policy depended on early nuclear\nbombing (\u201cmassive retaliation\u201d) as the cheapest way to respond to a Soviet\nattack, RAND\u2019s top issues were nuclear strategy, surviving nuclear attack,\nand response options. Because SAC bombers had a monopoly on\ntransporting America\u2019s nuclear arsenal and General LeMay sat at the\npinnacle of the world\u2019s military might, RAND\u2019s voice was often influential.\nBy the time Savage visited Santa Monica that summer RAND reports had\nalready challenged some of SAC\u2019s sacred cows.

At 33, Ikl\u00e9\nwas seven years younger than Savage and had earned a Ph.D. in 1950 from\nthe University of Chicago, where Savage was teaching.

Bayes\u2019 rule was emerging in fits and starts from the secrecy\nof the Second World War and the Cold War.\nThe H-bomb problem facing Madansky was politically and statistically\ntricky. No atomic or hydrogen weapon had ever exploded accidentally. In the\n12 years since the United States had dropped atomic bombs on Japan in\nAugust 1945, nuclear bombs had been detonated, but always deliberately, as\npart of a weapons test. Barring accidents, the nation\u2019s leaders believed that\ntheir stocks of nuclear weapons deterred all chance of thermonuclear war\u2014\nand that accidents could not occur in the future because none had occurred in\nthe past. Nonetheless, the question remained: could the impossible happen?\nAccording to more than a century of conventional statistics, the impossible\ncould not be calculated. Jakob Bernoulli had decreed in 1713 that highly\nimprobable events do not happen. David Hume agreed, arguing that because\nthe sun had risen thousands of times in the past it would continue to do so. It\nwas Thomas Bayes\u2019 friend and editor, Richard Price, who took the contrary\nview that the highly improbable could still occur. During the nineteenth and\nearly twentieth centuries, Antoine-Augustin Cournot concluded that the\nprobability of a physically impossible event was infinitely small and thus the\nevent would never occur. Andrei Kolmogorov slightly refined \u201cnever\u201d by\nsaying that if the probability of an event is very small, we can be practically\ncertain that the event will not happen in the very next trial.\nFisher was no help either. He argued that probability is a simple relative\nfrequency in an infinitely large population; until a nuclear bomb accident\noccurred, he had no way of judging its future probability. Mercifully,\nMadansky did not have an infinitely large population of H-bomb accidents,\nand further experimentation was out of the question.

But in 1958 Lindley\nshowed that when uniform priors are used, Fisher\u2019s fiducial probability and\nBayesian inference produce identical solutions.\nStill another fissure occurred when Allan Birnbaum derived George A.\nBarnard\u2019s likelihood principle from generally accepted frequentist principles\nand showed that he needed to take into account only observed data, not\ninformation that might have arisen from the experiment but had not. Another\nfrequentist complained that Birnbaum was \u201cpropos[ing] to push the clock\nback 45 years, but at least this puts him ahead of the Bayesians, who would", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2145, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d66ce94-191d-4a85-8bfc-f84ceba44748": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d66ce94-191d-4a85-8bfc-f84ceba44748", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf_part_157", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "hash": "083870c07276de7c4fa2c984fd14c735b5ee4a8f9af7761cce31188c02b317a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6bb35fed-862e-4cc0-8f22-63a5726fa1e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "da0c1d72517925013839aa3ccde83aa52f0a473ea7b217a80be8c88685859f53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "like to turn the clock back 150 years.\u201d9 Jimmie Savage, however, praised\nBirnbaum\u2019s work as a \u201chistoric occasion.\u201d10\nSavage also damned Fisher\u2019s fiducial method for using parts of Bayes\nwhile avoiding the opprobrium attached to priors.

Lindley\u2019s Paradox occurs when a precise hypothesis is\ntested with vast amounts of data. In 1987, Princeton University aeronautics\nengineering professor Robert G. Jahn conducted a large study which he\nconcluded supported the existence of psychokinetic powers. He reported that\na random event generator had produced 104,490,000 trials testing the\nhypothesis that someone on a couch eight feet away cannot influence their\nresults any more than random chance would. Jahn reported that the random\nevent generator produced 18,471 more examples (0.018%) of human\ninfluence on his sensitive microelectronic equipment than could be expected\nwith chance alone. Even with a p-value as small as 0.00015, the frequentist\nwould reject the hypothesis (and conclude in favor of psychokinetic powers)\nwhile the same evidence convinces a Bayesian that the hypothesis against\nspiritualism is almost certainly true.\nSix years later, Jimmie Savage, Harold Lindman, and Ward Edwards at the\nUniversity of Michigan showed that results using Bayes and the frequentist\u2019s\np-values could differ by significant amounts even with everyday-sized data\nsamples; for instance, a Bayesian with any sensible prior and a sample of\nonly 20 would get an answer ten times or more larger than the p-value.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1965, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bb35fed-862e-4cc0-8f22-63a5726fa1e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bb35fed-862e-4cc0-8f22-63a5726fa1e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf_part_157", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "hash": "083870c07276de7c4fa2c984fd14c735b5ee4a8f9af7761cce31188c02b317a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0d66ce94-191d-4a85-8bfc-f84ceba44748", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "hash": "38376125c39e4e05174ee9ce2280c0a9832b13e0905dd7b8bd0b2577b865dc88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Lindley ran afoul of Fisher\u2019s temper when he reviewed Fisher\u2019s third\nbook and found \u201cwhat I thought was a very basic, serious error in it: Namely,\nthat [Fisher\u2019s] fiducial probability doesn\u2019t obey the rules of probability.

In\nturn, Savage recognized that Schlaifer had developed his ideas \u201cwholly\nindependently\u201d and was more \u201cdown to earth and less spellbound by\ntradition.\u201d26\nMulling over the state of Bayes\u2019 rule, Schlaifer and Raiffa realized that\nBayesians, unlike frequentists, had no bookshelves of mathematical tools\nready for use.

While theoreticians like Savage and Lindley\ntried to make Bayes mathematically respectable, Raiffa and Schlaifer set out\nin 1958 to make it fully operational and easy to use for bread-and-butter\nproblems. Like George Box, they parodied a popular song, this one from\nAnnie Get Your Gun, claiming that anything a frequentist could do, they could\ndo better.\nTo make calculations easier, they introduced decision trees, tree-flipping,\nand conjugate priors. \u201cI began using decision tree diagrams that depicted the\nsequential nature of decision problems faced by business managers,\u201d Raiffa\nsaid. \u201cShould I, as decision maker, act now or wait to collect further\nmarketing information (by sampling or further engineering)? . . .

DuPont, trying to decide how\nbig a factory to build for artificial shoe leather in 1962, was delighted to\nassess the prior odds of the demand for its new product. Design engineers at\nFord Motor Company were equally pleased that incorporating their opinions\ninto Bayes\u2019 prior let Ford use smaller opinion samples. Their work opened\nup just about any business problem to mathematical analysis. An engineering\nproblem might have 20 sources of uncertainty; of these, perhaps 12 could be\nhandled by single guesses; 5 needed more testing; and 2 might be so critical\nthat experts had to be interviewed. Bayes\u2019 rule was solving far more\ncomplex problems than Savage\u2019s mental exercises about curling rabbit ears.\nBetween 1961 and 1965 an exciting weekly seminar, generally followed\nby drinks in Schlaifer\u2019s office, focused on decision making under uncertainty\n(DUU for short). The seminar explored utility analysis, portfolio analysis,\ngroup decision processes, theory of syndicates, behavioral anomalies, and\nways to ask about uncertainties and values. Said Raiffa, \u201cWe helped shape a\nfield.\u201d30 The seminar and two books Raiffa and Schlaifer cowrote during this\nperiod spurred the Bayesian revival of the 1960s. Raiffa was later surprised\nto realize that the most fertile period of his collaboration with Schlaifer had\nlasted only four years.\nRaiffa\u2019s and Schlaifer\u2019s classic book for advanced statisticians, Applied\nStatistical Decision Theory, was published in 1961. Its careful, detailed\nanalytical methods set the direction of Bayesian statistics for the next two\ndecades.

Joining the 1950s and 1960s push to apply\nmathematical models to social problems, he researched game theory,\ngambling, and learning, where Bayes\u2019 theorem itself was not used but served\nas a metaphor for thinking and accommodating new ideas.

As part of the government\u2019s\npost-Sputnik push to teach students at every level about probability,\nMosteller wrote two textbooks about frequentism and Bayes\u2019 rule for high\nschool students.

In preparation for Election Day, NBC went looking for someone to\nhelp it predict the winner. In the first of a series of surprises, the network\napproached a Princeton University professor, John W. Tukey.\nToday Tukey is best known for the terms \u201cbit\u201d and \u201csoftware,\u201d and few\noutside statistics and engineering recognize his name. But he was a man of\nstaggering accomplishments in the cloak-and-dagger world of military\nresearch, especially in code breaking and high-tech weaponry. He worked\ntwo jobs 30 miles apart: at Princeton University, where he was a professor\nof statistics, and at AT&T\u2019s Bell Laboratories, then widely considered the\nfinest industrial research laboratory in the world. From these vantage points,\nhe advised five successive U.S. presidents, the National Security Agency,\nand the Central Intelligence Agency.\nTo appreciate the audacity of NBC\u2019s job offer to Tukey, one needs to\nunderstand how deeply he was embedded in Cold War secrets. He had done\nresearch on topology in the late 1930s and military analysis in the 1940s. As\na young man during the Second World War, Tukey worked in Princeton with\nthe Operations Research Group that computed how a B-29 bomber speeding\nover Europe should aim its machine-gun fire. With pencil and paper during\nthe Cold War, he broad-brushed the aerodynamics, trajectory, and warhead\nfor the Nike, the first antiaircraft surface-to-air missile system. He also\nhelped persuade Eisenhower to build the U-2, the spy plane that flew from\n1956 until 1960, the year a U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down\nover the USSR.\nWhen NBC News approached Tukey in 1960, he had been a member of the\nCIA\u2019s Science and Technology Advisory Panel and the National Security\nAgency\u2019s Science Advisory Board for eight years.

First, the reputation of opinion surveys, the mainstay of social\nscience, was abysmal. Although sampling forms the foundation of statistics,\ncommercial pollsters were painfully slow to adopt probabilistic random\nsampling. Serving on the Kinsey Report study committee with Mosteller,\nTukey said he would prefer a random sample of three to a Kinsey sample of\n300; Kinsey\u2019s wife said she wanted to poison him. If Tukey aimed to\nimprove statistical practices in the polling industry, NBC News was a high-\nprofile place to start.\nSecond, NBC\u2019s RCA computers may have been a draw. If Tukey accepted\nNBC\u2019s offer, he would not need an army of students to snip pieces of adding\nmachine paper. RCA was a major military contractor as well as a giant in\ncommunications; it manufactured highly regarded mainframe computers for\nthe military and big business. During the 1940s the company\u2019s large research\nlaboratory had designed and built the Selectron memory tube for early\ncomputers, including von Neumann\u2019s Johnniac.\nThe opportunity to use RCA\u2019s computers to analyze election data must\nhave been tempting. Tukey had foreseen the intimate connection between\ncomputers and statistics years earlier. When von Neumann designed an\nelectronic computer for the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton in late\n1945, Tukey was the only Princeton University representative on the\ncommittee and helped design the computer\u2019s architecture and electronic\nadding circuit. Still, Tukey\u2019s \u201cmost striking relationship with the computer\nwas that he didn\u2019t use it\u201d; his hardware consisted of pencil and paper.9\nPolling reform and powerful computers, however, may have paled in\nimportance next to the allure of NBC\u2019s vast amounts of voting data.

Network executives hustled the statisticians into a\nroom without telephones, locked them in and refused to let them out until 8\na.m. Tukey and his team twiddled their thumbs all night, unable to release\ntheir results until morning, when it was clear Kennedy had won.

Good is the\nprincipal contributor to the Bayesian group and he was taking that\nposition.\u201d29 Good was Alan Turing\u2019s cryptographic assistant during the\nSecond World War. So did Tukey use Bayes\u2019 rule for decoding for the\nNational Security Agency? And could he have been distancing himself from\nBayesian methods in order to protect work there?\nThe ties between Tukey, Bayes, and top-secret decoding are many and\nclose.

First, they\nestablished a search grid around the blip that Craven had identified as the\nprobable location of the Scorpion\u2019s explosion. Each cell in the grid\nmeasured one mile north\u2013south and 0.84 miles east\u2013west, for a total of 140\nsquare miles.\nAt Richardson\u2019s suggestion, the stateside search team made a key decision\nto use Monte Carlo methods to model the sub\u2019s movements before and after\nthe accident. Physicists on the Manhattan Project had pioneered Monte Carlo\ntechniques for tracking the probable paths of neutrons in a chain reaction\nexplosion. Richardson substituted \u201clittle hypothetical submarines\u201d for the\nneutrons. Academic Bayesians would not adopt Monte Carlo methods for\nanother 20 years.\nStarting with Craven\u2019s probable location of the explosion (the blip), a\nmainframe computed the probabilities that, in its death throes, the submarine\nchanged course and traveled, for example, another mile in any of several\nrandom directions. Using Thomas Bayes\u2019 simplification, Richardson began\nby considering each of those directions as equally probable.

But shortly after the Suez Canal\nwas cleared and Theory of Optimal Search was published, intensive efforts\nwere made to adapt Bayesian methods to moving targets: civilian boats adrift\nin predictable currents and winds.\nThe technology was a perfect match for U.S. Coast Guard rescue\ncoordinators like Joseph Discenza, whose job in the late 1960s was to\nanswer the telephone when someone called saying, \u201cMy husband went out\nfishing with my son, and they\u2019re not back.\u201d15 After checking area ports of call\nfor the boat, he used a Coast Guard Search and Rescue Manual to estimate by\nhand the target\u2019s location and its probable drift.\n\u201cLike a dog with a bone in his teeth,\u201d Discenza started to computerize the\nCoast Guard\u2019s manual.16 He studied search theory and earned a master\u2019s\ndegree at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, and a Ph.D.\nat New York University.

And in doing so he\ndiscovered a remarkable, hitherto unknown event in British history. Raftery\u2019s\nBayesian analysis revealed that accident rates plummeted suddenly in the late\n1880s or early 1890s. A historian friend suggested why. In 1889, British\nminers had formed the militant Miners\u2019 Federation (which later became the\nNational Union of Mine Workers). Safety was their number one issue. Almost\novernight, coal mines got safer.\n\u201cIt was a Eureka moment,\u201d Raftery said. \u201cIt was quite a thrill. And without\nBayesian statistics, it would have been much harder to do a test of this\nhypothesis.\u201d5 Frequency-based statistics worked well when one hypothesis\nwas a special case of the other and both assumed gradual behavior. But when\nhypotheses were competing and neither was a special case of the other,\nfrequentism was not as helpful, especially with data involving abrupt\nchanges\u2014like the formation of a militant union.\nRaftery wound up publishing two papers in 1986 about modeling abrupt\nrate changes. His first, frequentist paper was long, dense, and virtually\nunread. His second, Bayesian paper was shorter, simpler, and had a much\ngreater impact. Raftery\u2019s third 1986 paper ran just 1-1/4 pages and had an\nimmediate effect on sociologists.

Scaring healthy\npeople and retesting them with more sophisticated procedures would have\nbeen extremely costly.\nIn much the same way, but more controversially, a Bayesian approach\nshowed that an expensive MRI test for breast cancer might be appropriate for\na woman whose family had many breast cancer patients but inappropriate for\ngiving every woman between 40 and 50 years of age.

As\npart of this endeavor, linguists like Noam Chomsky developed structural\nrules for English sentences, subjects, verbs, adjectives, and grammar but\nfailed to produce an algorithm that could explain why one string of words\nmakes an English sentence while another string does not.\nDuring the 1970s IBM had two competing teams working on a similar\nproblem, speech recognition. One group, filled with linguists, studied the\nrules of grammar. The other group, led by Mercer and Brown, who later went\nto RenTech, was filled with mathematically inclined communications\nspecialists, computer scientists, and engineers. They took a different tack,\nreplaced logical grammar with Bayes\u2019 rule, and were ignored for a decade.\nMercer\u2019s ambition was to make computers do intelligent things, and voice\nrecognition seemed to be the way to make this happen. For both Mercer and\nBrown speech recognition was a problem about taking a signal that had\npassed through a noisy channel like a telephone and then determining the\nmost probable sentence that the speaker had in mind. Ignoring grammar rules,\nthey decided to figure out the statistical probability that words and phrases in\none language would wind up as particular words or phrases in another. They\ndid not have to know any language at all. They were simply computing the\nprobability of a single word given all the words that preceded it in a\nsentence.

From them, IBM extracted about\nthree million pairs of sentences, almost 99% of which were actual\ntranslations of one another.

For example,\nwhile the English shouted, \u2018Hear! Hear!,\u2019 the French said, \u2018Bravo!\u2019 So we\nbegan working on getting a better alignment of the sentences. We were using\nthe same methods as in speech recognition: Bayes\u2019 theorem and hidden\nMarkov models.\u201d The latter are particularly useful for recognizing patterns\nthat involve likely time sequences, for example, predicting one word in a\nsentence based on the previous word.\nIn a landmark paper in 1990 the group applied Bayes\u2019 theorem to full\nsentences.

The public\nreaction was immediate\u2014and in large part\u2014enraged. Here\u2019s a simple\nversion of the Bayesian calculation that lay at the very heart of the\ncontroversy.\nA 40-year-old woman without any symptoms or family history of breast\ncancer has a mammogram as part of a routine checkup. A week later she\nreceives a letter saying her test result was abnormal. She needs additional\ntesting. What is the probability she actually has breast cancer?\nQuite low.\nMany beginning statistics students\u2014and many physicians\u2014find this\nsurprising because mammograms, as a screening test, are reasonably\naccurate. They identify roughly 80% of 40-year-old women who have breast\ncancer at the time of their exam, and they provide positive test results to only\nabout 10% of women without the disease.\nHowever, breast cancer is relatively rare. And Bayes\u2019 rule takes back-\nground disease rates into account as prior knowledge. As a result, Bayes\nhighlights the fact that not everyone who gets a positive test for a disease\nactually has that disease. It also underscores the fact that the probability of\nbreast cancer is higher in a woman who finds a lump in her breast than in a\nwoman who has a mammogram as part of a routine checkup.\nTo illustrate:\n According to this formula, we need three pieces of information, which\nwill all go on the right-hand side of the equation:", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1533, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad7a9a8e-13d7-4f88-a2eb-48ec13f8dc68": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad7a9a8e-13d7-4f88-a2eb-48ec13f8dc68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "288", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf_part_287", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "288", "file_name": "TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/sylviathsu/Documents/COS243/LocalAILibrarian/library/TheTheoryThatWouldNotDie.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 2592963, "creation_date": "2024-12-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-12-24"}, "hash": "f182ee3a7b6e55b3f8709fa617401279b75d14dcfb65bd2515f923ea35327923", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1. The probability of having breast cancer: This is our prior knowledge\nabout the background disease rate of breast cancer among women in\ntheir forties at the time they get a mammogram. Ac-cording to Cancer\nand Jama, this is approximately 4/10 of 1%. Thus out of every\n10,000 women in their forties who have mammograms, we can\nestimate that approximately 40 actually have the disease. The\nnumber: 40/10,000.\n2. The probability of a breast cancer patient getting a positive\nmammogram: According to the National Cancer Institute and\nevidence from mammography, approximately 32 of those 40 women\nwith breast cancer will get a positive test result from the\nmammogram. The number: 32/10,000.\n3. The probability of getting a positive mammogram: The total number\nof women who get positive results (whether or not cancer is present)\ninclude women with cancer and women who are falsely informed that\nthey have the disease. Mammograms give a positive (\u201cabnormal\u201d)\nresult to some women who do not have the disease; they are called\nfalse positives. For mammography, this rate is quite high,\napproximately 10%, according to the New England Journal of\nMedicine. Thus out of 10,000 women in their forties, 996 will get a\nletter telling them they have an abnormal test result. To rule out breast\ncancer, these women will need more mammography, ultrasound, or\ntissue sampling, perhaps even a biopsy. To this number must be\nadded the 32 breast cancer patients per 10,000 who will get a\npositive mammogram. The total number: 1028/10,000 or a little more\nthan 10% of the women screened.\nInserting these numbers into the formula, we get the following:\n Doing the arithmetic produces 0.03, or 3%. Thus the probability that a\nwoman who tests positive has breast cancer is only 3%. She has 97 chances\nout of 100 to be disease free.\nNone of this is static.
